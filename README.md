# SYMmetric POWer elliptic curve L-functions

__SYMPOW__ is a mathematical program to compute special values of symmetric
power elliptic curve L-functions; it can compute up to about 64 digits
of precision.

## Installation

Note that __SYMPOW__ is a dependency of [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/):
if [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) is installed on your computer,
__SYMPOW__ must be already present.

Otherwise, when applicable, it is highly recommended to install __SYMPOW__ through
the package manager system of your Operating System.

```sh
# Debian derivatives
sudo apt install sympow
```

As a (very) last resort, you can always build and install __SYMPOW__
as you are used to do with any other classical Open Source Software
that comes with its own building-installing machinery.

## Bug reports, feature requests and ideas

Please submit _bug reports_, _feature requests_ or _ideas_ through the GitLab website
[https://gitlab.com/rezozer/forks/sympow](https://gitlab.com/rezozer/forks/sympow) .

## Versioning

The __forked source versioning__ is based on the original source versioning as follows:
 - the _major version number_ is incremented by one
 - the _minor version number_ remains unchanged
 - the _micro version number_ (or _patch version number_) numbers the fork version

Notice that the two first forked versions are special:
 - sympow forked version _2.023.0_ is the original source itself (modulo this README.md file)
 - sympow forked version _2.023.1_ is the source as patched by Debian on June 2018 (Debian version _1.023-9_)
